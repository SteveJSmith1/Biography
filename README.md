Hi Humans (and bots)!

Steve here, I enjoy the delights of Python.
I enjoy working with nltk to analyse text in a variety of forms.
I also enjoy working with pandas and numpy to analyse numerical data.
Ex-lecturer in Mathematics trying less-altruistic ways to make a living.

Freelance remote working offers always gratefully received.
